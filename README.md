## Setting Up Colab Local Connection

Follow these steps to connect Colab to your local instance:

1. **Go to Colab and Choose to Connect to a Local Instance**  
   - Open your [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/).
   - In the top-right corner, select the option to **Connect to a Local Runtime**.

2. **Run the GitHub Action**  
   - Trigger the GitHub Action provided in this repository. This will handle the setup and start the required services.

3. **Find the Ngrok TCP Tunnel URL**  
   - In the output logs of the GitHub Action, locate the section that displays the Ngrok TCP Tunnel URL.  
     Example output:  
     ```bash
     Run echo "Ngrok TCP Tunnel:"
     Ngrok TCP Tunnel:
     tcp://4.tcp.ngrok.io:16824
     ```

4. **Forward the Connection to Your Local Port**  
   - Use the `socat` command to forward the Ngrok TCP Tunnel to your local port (e.g., port 9000).  
     Replace the values as needed based on the Ngrok TCP Tunnel URL from the logs.  
     Example command:  
     ```bash
     socat TCP-LISTEN:9000,reuseaddr,fork TCP:4.tcp.ngrok.io:16824
     ```

5. **Wait for the Docker Image to Pull and Start**  
   - The GitHub Action will pull the required Docker image and start the container. This step may take a few minutes depending on your network speed.

6. **Retrieve the Link and Password**  
   - Once the setup is complete, a link with a password will be provided in the output logs of the GitHub Action.

7. **Paste the Link into Colab**  
   - Copy the link with the password provided in the previous step.
   - Paste it into the field for connecting to the local runtime in Colab.
