## Setting Up Colab Local Connection

Follow these steps to connect Colab to your local instance:

1. **Go to Colab and Choose to Connect to a Local Instance**  
   - Open your [Google Colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/).
   - In the top-right corner, select the option to **Connect to a Local Runtime**.

2. **Run the GitHub Action**  
   - Go to the **Actions** tab of this repository: [GitHub Actions Page](https://github.com/bugparty/colab_local/actions).  
   - Locate the **Run Colab GHCR** workflow in the list of workflows on the left-hand side.  
   - Click on the workflow to open its details page.
   - Click the **Run workflow** button (usually located in the upper-right corner).  
     - Ensure you select the `master` branch from the dropdown menu before running the workflow.
   - The workflow will initialize and execute the following steps:
     - Pull the required Docker image.
     - Start the container.
     - Set up a secure **Ngrok TCP Tunnel** for remote connection.

3. **Find the Ngrok TCP Tunnel URL**  
   - Once the workflow starts, the logs will display the **Ngrok TCP Tunnel URL**.  
     Example output:  
     ```bash
     Run echo "Ngrok TCP Tunnel:"
     Ngrok TCP Tunnel:
     tcp://4.tcp.ngrok.io:16824
     ```

4. **Forward the Connection to Your Local Port**  
   - Use the `socat` command to forward the Ngrok TCP Tunnel to your local port (e.g., port 9000).  
   - Replace the values as needed based on the Ngrok TCP Tunnel URL from the logs.  
     Example command:  
     ```bash
     socat TCP-LISTEN:9000,reuseaddr,fork TCP:4.tcp.ngrok.io:16824
     ```

5. **Wait for the Docker Image to Pull and Start**  
   - The GitHub Action will pull the required Docker image and start the container. This may take a few minutes depending on your network speed.

6. **Retrieve the Link and Password**  
   - Once the action completes, the logs will provide a link and password for connecting to the instance.

7. **Paste the Link into Colab**  
   - Copy the link with the password provided in the logs.  
   - Paste it into the Google Colab notebook when connecting to the local runtime.

## Why Use This Setup?

Google Colab is a powerful tool for free users, but it has certain hardware limitations. Based on benchmark results:  
- **Colab Free Tier CPUs**: Limited to a single core of an older Intel CPU, which can significantly slow down CPU-bound tasks.  
- **GitHub Actions Runner**: Provides access to modern 4-core AMD EPYC processors, offering much better performance for computational tasks.  

By leveraging GitHub Actions to set up a local runtime, you can take advantage of this improved hardware while still using Colab's convenient interface. This setup is especially beneficial for tasks that require higher CPU performance or parallel processing.

## Installing `socat` on macOS

Follow these steps to install `socat` on macOS:

1. **Install Homebrew (If Not Already Installed)**  
   - Open the Terminal and run the following command to install Homebrew:  
     ```bash
     /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
     ```
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

2. **Install `socat` Using Homebrew**  
   - Once Homebrew is installed, run the following command to install `socat`:  
     ```bash
     brew install socat
     ```

3. **Verify Installation**  
   - After installation, check if `socat` is installed by running:  
     ```bash
     socat -h
     ```
   - If installed correctly, this command will display the help information for `socat`.
